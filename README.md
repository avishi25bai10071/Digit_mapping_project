# Digit_mapping_project
Python program that separates each digit of the numbers from 1 to n and stores them and display them in form of list and allow the user to an index and display the original number from which that digit was taken. <br>
PROJECT TITLE: Digit seperation and original Number Finder <br>
Overview: This Program aims to generate a continuous list of digits by seperating every number from 1 to n into its individual digits. <br>
After creating the list, user is allowed to enter an index value which traces back and display the complete number from which the selected digit was taken.
FEATURES: 	 Digit Seperation	 Original Number Tracking	 Index-Bases Retrieval
Technologies/Tools Used:	Python Programming language
	Visual Studio Code
	Basic Python Libraries
	Terminal
Steps To Install & Run The Project:
	Open The Python File and run the code.
	Enter the required inputs.
    •	First, The program will ask for the value of number you want to separate.
    •	Then it will ask for an index for which you want the original number.
	Check the Output.
Instructions for Testing:
	Start the Program.
	Enter The Value of n.	Check the generated digit list.
   •	All numbers from 1 to n have been seperated into individual.
   •	The last digit of n has been removed.
	Enter a Test Index.
	Verify The Output.
	Test Multiple Index Values.
	Validate Mapping Logic.
	Observe Program Stability.
