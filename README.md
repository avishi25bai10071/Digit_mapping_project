# Digit_mapping_project
Python program that separates each digit of the numbers from 1 to n and stores them and display them in form of list and allow the user to an index and display the original number from which that digit was taken.
PROJECT TITLE: Digit seperation and original Number Finder
Overview: This Program aims to generate a continuous list of digits by seperating every number from 1 to n into its individual digits.
After creating the list, user is allowed to enter an index value which traces back and display the complete number from which the selected digit was taken.
FEATURES: 
1.	 Digit Seperation
2.	 Original Number Tracking
3.	 Index-Bases Retrieval
Technologies/Tools Used:
1.	Python Programming language
2.	Visual Studio Code
3.	Basic Python Libraries
4.	Terminal
Steps To Install & Run The Project:
1.	Open The Python File and run the code.
2.	Enter the required inputs.
    •	First, The program will ask for the value of number you want to separate.
    •	Then it will ask for an index for which you want the original number.
3.	Check the Output.
Instructions for Testing:
1.	Start the Program.
2.	Enter The Value of n.
3.	Check the generated digit list.
   •	All numbers from 1 to n have been seperated into individual.
   •	The last digit of n has been removed.
4.	Enter a Test Index.
5.	Verify The Output.
6.	Test Multiple Index Values.
7.	Validate Mapping Logic.
8.	Observe Program Stability.
