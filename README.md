# Digit_mapping_project <br>
Python program that separates each digit of the numbers from 1 to n and stores them and display them in form of list and allow the user to an index and display the original number from which that digit was taken. <br>
PROJECT TITLE: Digit seperation and original Number Finder <br>
Overview: <br> This Program aims to generate a continuous list of digits by seperating every number from 1 to n into its individual digits. <br>
After creating the list, user is allowed to enter an index value which traces back and display the complete number from which the selected digit was taken.<br>
FEATURES: <br>
1. Digit Seperation	<br>
2. Original Number Tracking	 <br>
3. Index-Bases Retrieval <br>
Technologies/Tools Used:<br>
1. Python Programming language<br>
2. Visual Studio Code <br>
3. Basic Python Libraries <br>
4. Terminal <br>
Steps To Install & Run The Project: <br>
1. Open The Python File and run the code. <br>
2. Enter the required inputs. <br>
    •	First, The program will ask for the value of number you want to separate. <br>
    •	Then it will ask for an index for which you want the original number.<br>
3. Check the Output. <br>
Instructions for Testing: <br>
1. Start the Program. <br>
2. Enter The Value of n. <br>	3.Check the generated digit list. <br>
   •	All numbers from 1 to n have been seperated into individual. <br>
   •	The last digit of n has been removed. <br>
4. Enter a Test Index. <br>
5. Verify The Output. <br>
6. Test Multiple Index Values. <br>
7. Validate Mapping Logic. <br>
8. Observe Program Stability.<br>
